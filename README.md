# Introduction
Immunotherapy aimed to boost natural defences to eliminate malignant cells is a breakthrough for cancer treatment and has revolutionized the field of oncology.  Therapeutic strategies like cell transfer and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been demonstrated highly effective against various types of cancer (including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, lung cancer, and (Hodi et al. 2010; Motzer et al. 2015; Littman 2015; Emens et al. 2021; Gandhi et al. 2018; Forde et al. 2018). However, it shows varying response rates among cancer (Li et al. 2020; Thompson et al. 2022) and a considerable number of patients are not sensitive to immunotherapy, but the underlying mechanisms remain (Wei, Duffy, and Allison 2018).

Identification of individual patients susceptible or resistant to immunotherapy is a crucial point in improving response rates to cancer therapy and patient survival.

In recent years, the intestinal microbiota has been shown to significantly affect the immunotherapy of malignant tumors (Snyder, Pamer, and Wolchok 2015; Schluter et al. 2020; Swami, Zakharia, and Zhang 2018; Strouse, Mangalam, and Zhang 2019; Chau and Zhang 2021), which can be considered as a basis for the development of robust predictive tools for the identification of immunotherapy-sensitive patients. 

Moreover, several studies have demonstrated that gut microbiota modulation let enhance Immunotherapy response.  For example, the efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 therapy was strongly positively associated with intestinal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Bacteroides fragilis (Vétizou et al. 2015); oral intake of Bifidobacterium under anti–PD-L1 antibody therapy of melanoma significantly improves clinical response in mouse models (Sivan et al. 2015). Bifidobacterium was also effective to suppress lung cancer metastasis (Zhu et al. 2020) and reducing Immune-Related Adverse Events in lung cancer ICIs therapy (Chau et al. 2021). 

Thus Identification of microbial signatures associated with positive therapy response will allow us to propose novel promising candidates for enhancing melanoma immunotherapy.

Here we developed Machine learning-based predictive models utilizing gut metagenomic data to identify clinical response status in melanoma immunotherapy; microbial signatures as well as taxonomic assignments associated with it were also identified.

# Goal of the project
Confirm the hypothesis of melanoma immunotherapy response status 
can be predicted from gut microbiomes using machine learning models

# Objectives
* Build a predictive model based on Random Forest classifier;
* Validate model with cross-validation;
* Identify taxonomical as well as functional signatures, which can be used as biomarkers to predict the clinical response status


# Methods
To examine taxonomic and functional features distinguishing people with different immunotherapy response (Rs and NRs), we used Random forest classifier (RFC). Most important features was then analyzed using literature. 

Batch correction was performed with `ConQuR` package for **R 4.3.0**.
RFC model was trained with `sklearn` package with **python 3.9**. Another python packages used in research are named in `requirements.txt`. 

Overall pipline is:

1. Generate tables with feature frequencies - with **MetaPhlAn**, **MAGs** and **KEGG Ortology**
2. Batch effect correction with ConQuR
4. RFC model validation with corrected and uncorrected data 
5. Extraction of the importances from the models trained on batch-corrected data
6. Analysis of the most important features

# Results
### Model validation
Using uncorrected data, RFC model has demostrated acceptable accuracy with shuffle- split CV (5-fold CV row at the pic.1), but very poor results with 6-vs-1 testing (pic 1) due to severe batch-effect. To gain potentially more accurate feature importances, we performed batch effect correction with ConQuR, which evaluated accuracy up to 100% because of pre-training. This pre-training, however, still allows as to research the importance of model's features, because there is no goal to predict the immunotherapy status of the new patients.

Next three pictures demonstrate performance of the models trained on batch-**uncorrected** data using 5-fold shuffle-split CV.

### Importances

Next step was to extract the importances, and aiming to get importances reproducible across all datasets, we used the mean importance of the feature, which is calculated from 7 importances obtained from 7 models trained on 7 datasets, batch-corrected with different reference batch. Next 4 pictures are top 30 most important features from each of united, MPA, KEGG and MAGs trained models.

MAGs:

Resulting tables are available in current repository in the `results/` folder.

### Feature annotation and intersection

KEGG Orrhology annotation was not quite resultative: we are failed to link the most important KOs to any pathways important in cancer pathology.

However, reasonable result was obtained with comparsion of top 70 important MAGs and MetaPhlAn features: 29 of them was common bacteria (listed below). More details are in the table named `intersection.xlsx` in the `results/` folder.

# Conclusion
We Identify 29 intestinal microbes, which can be associated with positive immunotherapy response of melanoma patients and can be considered promising candidates for biomarkers of melanoma treatment clinical response status.

Here we demonstrated that Machine Learning approach can be efficiency used for the prediction of immunotherapy response as well as for research purposes. 

However, for clinical use the ML-based predictive approach requires experimental confirmation.
